{"ast":null,"code":"/**\n  # rtc-pluggable-signaller\n\n  By using `rtc-pluggable-signaller` in your code, you provide the ability\n  for your package to customize which signalling client it uses (and\n  thus have significant control) over how signalling operates in your\n  environment.\n\n  ## How it Works\n\n  The pluggable signaller looks in the provided `opts` for a `signaller`\n  attribute.  If the value of this attribute is a string, then it is\n  assumed that you wish to use the default\n  [`rtc-signaller`](https://github.com/rtc-io/rtc-signaller) in your\n  package.  If, however, it is not a string value then it will be passed\n  straight back as the signaller (assuming that you have provided an\n  object that is compliant with the rtc.io signalling API).\n\n**/\nmodule.exports = function (opts) {\n  var signaller = (opts || {}).signaller;\n\n  var messenger = (opts || {}).messenger || require('rtc-switchboard-messenger');\n\n  if (typeof signaller == 'string' || signaller instanceof String) {\n    return require('rtc-signaller')(messenger(signaller, opts), opts);\n  }\n\n  return signaller;\n};","map":null,"metadata":{},"sourceType":"script"}
